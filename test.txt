Hello there. Hope you're doing good.

Please follow all steps one by one.

1. Create a new branch from this branch with your name. E.g. tawio_git_test
2. Create two files in your branch. Names of the files should be yourname.txt and a.txt. E.g. parita.txt and a.txt
3. Inside yourname.txt file add some intro about yourself.
4. Inside a.txt file write, "Edited by <Your Name>". E.g. Edited by Tashin
5. Commit these two files on your branch and push it to the remote. Give commit message as "This commit made by <Your name>"
6. After 5th point done, please checkout to git_test branch and merge your code and push.

** Make sure on git_test branch git log history is staying linear.**

Which means after Initial commit on this branch there will be only one commit from your side. So at the end of your test on git_test branch only 5 commits should be there. Intial commit and then 4 other commit message from 4 of you.


You have 30 minutes to complete your test.

Best of luck!
